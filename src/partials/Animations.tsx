        I remember being yelled at by a senior Java developer when I proudly integrated some atomic
        classes into our dinosaur project. It was back in 2018, I didnâ€™t back out and our collection
        of Tailwind CSS classes has been growing every day.
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        One of many stand-out features of Tailwind CSS is how it guides me to utilize edge CSS
        features simply by exploring its documentation.{' '}

        you plan to introduce are no exception to this. So I gave it a shot and turned some of their
        CSS into a plugin. This website is the real test; it uses them a lot.

        Animation Timeline

      <Paragraph>
        The single most impressive feature of scroll-driven animations is an anonymous animation
        timeline. It allows user to easily trigger anything just by scrolling the page. Utility
        below allows user to use the <Code>.timeline</Code> CSS class which defaults to{' '}
        <Code>animation-timeline: scroll(y)</Code> and also provides an option to set custom
        timeline name with a modifier.

        Scroll and View timelines provide user with better control over the animations. Both{' '}

        modifiers to set the timeline name.

      <Paragraph>
        Animation range controls start and end of an animation. Utility classes{' '}
        <Code>.range-start</Code> and <Code>.range-end</Code> can be used for setting the start and
        the end of the range. They default to <Code>entry</Code> and <Code>exit</Code> respectively.

      <Paragraph>
        Timeline scope allows to control animated elements outside the parent which defines the
        timeline. Utility <Code>.scope</Code> should be used with a modifier to define the timeline
        name set by <Code>.scroll-timeline</Code> or <Code>.view-timeline</Code>.

        Scroll-driven animations are not broadly supported yet. I added two <Code>@supports</Code>{' '}

      <Paragraph>
        This demo showcases the usage of scroll-driven animation to reveal the navigation bar. The{' '}
        <Code>.view-timeline/demo</Code> utility sets up the animation timeline, which is then
        scoped out of the defining element by <Code>.scope/demo</Code>. The navigation bar has the{' '}
        <Code>.timeline/demo</Code> CSS class, enabling it to be regulated by the timeline. Utility
        classes <Code>.range-start-exit-crossing</Code> and <Code>.range-end</Code> is set to limit
        the timeline duration.
