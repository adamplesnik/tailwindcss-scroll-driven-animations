      <Paragraph>
        I am married, 38 years old, father of two kids, living in Bratislava, Slovakia. While my
        passion for coding is obvious, I also enjoy mountain biking, traveling, and spending quality
        time with my family.

      <Paragraph>
        I can speak English and French fluently, and because I love Portugal, I'm also learning
        Portuguese.
