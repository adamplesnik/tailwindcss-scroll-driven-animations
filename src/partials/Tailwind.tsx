        I remember being yelled at by a senior Java developer when I proudly integrated some atomic
        classes into our dinosaur project. It was back in 2018, I didnâ€™t back out and our collection
        of Tailwind CSS classes has been growing every day.

        In addition to the job I'm paid for, I also love working on, even only by a fraction of
        time, a refactoring of an open-source project{' '}
        <Link
          href={'https://github.com/adamplesnik/webumenia.sk/tree/feature/css-refactoring'}
          Icon={Github}
          target={'_blank'}

        . I forked their dev branch and started the process of removing old code, reorganizing
        dependencies and integrating more Tailwind CSS.

        One aspect of Tailwind CSS that I especially love is how it guides me to utilize edge CSS
        features simply by exploring its documentation.{' '}
        <Link href={'#code-tailwind-1'} Icon={CornerRightDown} target={''}>
          Scroll-driven animations
        </Link>{' '}
        are no exception to this. So I gave it a shot and turned some of their CSS into a plugin.
        This website is the real test; it uses them a lot.
