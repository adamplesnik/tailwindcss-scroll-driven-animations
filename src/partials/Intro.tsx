      <Paragraph>
        I remember being yelled at by a senior Java developer when I proudly integrated some atomic
        classes into our dinosaur project. It was back in 2018, I didnâ€™t back out and our collection
        of Tailwind CSS classes has been growing every day.

      <Paragraph>

        edge CSS features simply by exploring its documentation.{' '}
        <Link href={'#code'} Icon={CornerRightDown} target={''}>
          Scroll-driven animations
        </Link>{' '}
